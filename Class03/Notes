Xpath:
Why do we need it?
1. Developer may not provide all the locators on HTML
2.  By using xpath and css we can identify elements with any given attributes
what is xpath?
is like a query language which help us to identify elements uniquely on the web page
Type of Xpath:
Absolute Xpath: starts from the starting node of the html
                it always starts with single slash(/)
                example: /html/body/div/div
Relative Xpath: start from any node in html
               always start with double slash

               syntax for relative xpath;
                // tagname[@attribute='value']
                example: //input[@id='email']
 When we use Xpath? When there is no locator  such as name, id etc.
 because in xpath we  can use any of attributes even
 thought they are not thr locator. but some companies just use Xpath instead
 using locator
 it on thir hand to choose whichever they wanna use.


identfiying elements by its text:
//tagname[text() ='text value']
//a[text()='Create new account']

Identifying elements by using .contains() method
//tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]
//h2[contains(text(),'the world')]
-->we use when we have very long attribute values.

starts-with will identify elements by its partial starting value
//tagname[starts-with(@attribute,'partial starting attribute value')])
example: //input[start-with(@aria-label,'Email')]

ends-with was used in xpath 1.0 we are using 2.0 and this method is not available

Advanced Xpath:
is based on parent and child, siblings relationship.
we can identifying element by following siblings
//tagname[@attribute='attribute value']/ following-sibling::tagname
we use it to locate something when we don't have the right attributes.
Identifying element by following sibling
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/following-sibling :: siblingTagname
e.g //input[@id = 'calFromDate']/following-sibling :: imp

identifying element by preceding sibling
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/preceding-sibling :: sibling's Tagname
e.g //span[text() = '& Orders']/preceding-sibling :: span

identifying elements by its parent
//tagname[@attributes='attribute values']/parent::parent's Tagname
